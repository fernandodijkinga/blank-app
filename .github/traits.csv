Health;"The Health Trait Index combines the following health traits, developed by the Council on Dairy Cattle Breeding, into one economic value. The traits included are Milk Fever, Displaced Abomasum, Ketosis, Mastitis, Metritis and Retained Placenta. Higher values are more desirable.

Health index = (0.34 x Hypocalcemia) + (1.97 x displaced abomasum) + (0.28 x ketosis) + (1.50 x mastitis) + (1.12 x metritis) + (0.68 x retained placenta)";-15;15;score;higher
ProductionEfficiency;"Feed Efficiency $ index reflects good feed utilization. It includes better utilization of the feed to produce extra pounds of milk, fat, and protein; feed saved from cows with a lower body weight and less maintenance costs; and feed saved from better feed conversion. This last part is known as residual feed intake (RFI), i.e., the difference in efficiency that we see between cows after accounting for the feed that goes into the maintenance of the cow and the production of milk. Production $ + Body Weight Composite $ + Residual Feed Intake $ FE$ is calculated as follows: FE$ = ($0.0008 x PTA Milk) + ($1.55 x PTA Fat) + ($1.73 x PTA Protein) + ($0.11 x Feed Saved)";-500;500;dollars;higher
FertilityAndFitness;The Fertility Index combines several reproductive components into one overall index: ability to conceive as a maiden heifer, ability to conceive as a lactating cow, and a cow’s overall ability to start cycling again, show heat, conceive, and maintain a pregnancy. The Fertility Index is derived from the formula: FI = 18% Heifer Conception Rate (HCR) + 18% Cow Conception Rate (CCR) + 64% Daughter Pregnancy Rate (DPR);-5;5;score;higher

TPI;Weighting of Major Categories: Production: 46% (Fat, Protein, Body Weight Composite, and Feed Efficiency), Health & Fertility: 28% (SCS, PL, HT, LIV, FI, DCE and DSB), Conformation: 26% (PTAT, UDC and FLC). Use of the TPI Formula will lead to: Additional pounds of Fat and Protein, with slightly more gain in Butterfat. Body Weight of the next generation of cows should be consistent with the current population. Greater feed efficiency through improved production, controlling maintenance costs, and better feed conversion. An added benefit of the better control of the size of our cattle is a lowering of the incidence of difficult births, with a slight improvement in the daughter's ability to deliver a live calf. Higher economic returns by lowering the incidence of on-farm deaths and improving the productive period of months-in-milk. Conformation of our cattle will continue to improve from genetic improvement of overall conformation (PTAT), udders and feet & legs. Dairy farmers using the TPI formula will be breeding a more profitable herd of cattle.;0;3400;score;higher
